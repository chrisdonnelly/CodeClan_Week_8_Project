# Mobile_App_Using_Java_and_Android_Studio

This personal project involved creating a mobile app using the Android Studio IDE. 

I was responsible for every stage of the development cycle.

The design stages included user journey maps, wireframes, MoSCoW analysis and prototyping. 

The app was written in Java.

I adopted a MVC pattern with a focus on SOLID principles.

Data was persisted thoughout the app useing SharedPrefrences.

The app provides a companion management tool for a well established table top game, a product that should have appeal to and demand from a pre-established audience.
